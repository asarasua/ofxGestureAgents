Introduction
------------

This addon tries to bridge openFrameworks and GestureAgents. GestureAgents is a framework for gesture recognition focused on some specific problems such as:

* Concurrent multi-tasking
* Multi-user interaction
* Gesture Composition

TL;DR GestureAgents provides the infrastructure to code gesture recognizers that automatically allow concurrent recognition while avoiding double interpretation of events.
